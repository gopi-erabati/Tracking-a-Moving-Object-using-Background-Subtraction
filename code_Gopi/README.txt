To run the code:
1. copy the car and highway sequence images into the current folder of code
2. Change the MATLAB presenet working directory (pwd) to current folder.
3. run back_sub_car.m  %for car sequence
	different methods are put in different sections, we can run sections 	independedntly after running the first section (which loads image 	sequences)
4. run back_sub_highway.m % for highway sequence
	different methods are put in different sections, we can run sections 	independedntly after running the first section (which loads image 		sequences)


Cheers!
